# Bear Tools 🧸

Bear Tools is a collection of semi-random automation-related scripts and utilities written in my free time.

## Design Principles 🍥

- Code should be _easy_ to use
- Code should be well documented
- (Python) code should be extensively type-hinted

## Install 🐍

```shell
pip3 install bear-tools
```

## Subpackages 📦
